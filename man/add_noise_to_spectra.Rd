\title{Creates spectra with technical replicates and noise}
\usage{
add_noise_to_spectra(
  spectra,
  n_runs,
  n_replicates,
  undeuterated_mass,
  mass_deviations,
  intensity_deviations
)
}
\arguments{
\item{spectra}{list created by the \code{\link[powerHaDeX]{get_spectra_list}}
function}

\item{n_runs}{number of technical replicates to create}

\item{n_replicates}{number of replicates of a spectrum for power calculation}

\item{mass_deviations}{mass deviation in parts per million. Either a single number
(then the error at each time point will be the same) or a vector of the same length
as number of unique time points in the experiment. The error will be sampled from
normal distribution with standard deviation equal to
\deqn{mass_deviations * undeuterated_mass/1e6}}

\item{intensity_deviations}{optional, standard deviations of random noise that
will be added to intensities. Either a single number (then the error at each
time point will be the same) or a vector of the same length as number of unique
time points in the experiment. The error will be sampled from normal distribution
with these standard deviations.}
