Description: Facilitates simulating and analyzing data coming from HDX-MS 
             experiments along with the possibility of comparing the power of 
             the tests verifying differences in the levels of deuterium uptake. 
             The simulation of mass spectra is a fast version of 
             <https://github.com/kanzy/HX-MS-Simulations>.
